# Runtime complexity + Jasmine tests

This is a combination of two lessons about  [Jasmine tests](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/main/testing-and-tdd/jasmine-testing.md) and [Runtime Complexity](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/main/runtime-complexity/runtime-complexity.md).

I put the two together to give myself more practice with making Jasmine tests, and to try the [Runtime Complexity lesson's challenge section](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/main/runtime-complexity/runtime-complexity.md#challenge).

The challenge was to [create functions that solved these prompts](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/main/runtime-complexity/runtime3-solving.md).

I haven't finished all the problems for the challenge, but this is what I've done so far.
