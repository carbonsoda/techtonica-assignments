            <h2>Boba / Bubble Tea</h2>

            <p>
                A lot of my friends love bubble tea, which have chewy tapioca pearls ("bubbles"). It's popular around many college campuses, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many things like classes are online and/or businesses have closed in the meantime.
                <blockquote>
                    "I miss boba so much :(" <br>
                    "There's no good boba places near me" <br>
                    "I wish I could afford boba more than once a week"
                </blockquote>
                <br> If you don't have access and/or the funds for boba, it's possible to make it yourself!! It's super easy and quick too.

                You can buy tapioca pearls and instant milk tea online. A friend and I have tested a few instant milk teas; we found that Casa Milky Flavor Teas and 3:15PM to be the best brands for bubble tea. There are other good ones, but cost wise don't work out.<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>For the Casa Milky Flavor Teas, we suggest the Okinawa (brown sugar) and Hokkaidou Sapporo varieties. </li>
                    <li>For 3:15PM, we suggest the Original and Earl Gray ones. <br>The Rose one is okay, but risky choice if you never tried any rose milk tea before.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
