            <h2>Boba / Bubble Tea</h2>

            <p>
                A lot of my friends love bubble tea, which have chewy tapioca pearls ("bubbles"). It's popular around many college campuses, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many things like classes are online and/or businesses have closed in the meantime.
                <blockquote>
                    "I miss boba so much :(" <br>
                    "There's no good boba places near me" <br>
                    "I wish I could afford boba more than once a week"
                </blockquote>
                <br> If you don't have access and/or the funds for boba, it's possible to make it yourself!! It's super easy and quick too.

                You can buy tapioca pearls and instant milk tea online. A friend and I have tested a few instant milk teas; we found that Casa Milky Flavor Teas and 3:15PM to be the best brands for bubble tea. There are other good ones, but cost wise don't work out.<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>For the Casa Milky Flavor Teas, we suggest the Okinawa (brown sugar) and Hokkaidou Sapporo varieties. </li>
                    <li>For 3:15PM, we suggest the Original and Earl Gray ones. <br>The Rose one is okay, but risky choice if you never tried any rose milk tea before.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                <h4>Instructions</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Fill a small or medium pot with 5 cups, or enough to fill the pot 2/3rds up (this can be eyeballed!)</li>
                    <li>Let water come to boil at high heat</li>
                    <li>Pour in the tapioca pearls</li>
                    <li>Slowly stir until all the pearls float to the surface (~1-2 min), making sure that pearls don't stick together</li>
                    <li>Lower the heat to medium and cover for ~ 5 minutes</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>At this point, there's some variation depending on your desired texture!</li>
                        <li>This part is a work in progress as I need to make sure my times are as accurate as possible.</li>
                    </ul>
                        
                    <li>Drain the pearls using a strainer and rinse with cold water. The pearls should still be warm</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For springier boba: fill a bowl with cold tap water and let the pearls rest for ~30 seconds</li>
                        <li>For firmer boba: use cold water from the fridge instead of tap</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Put the pearls in a bowl and cover it with the desired sweetener (note: multiple sweeteners can be used, ie maple syrup and a little bit of brown sugar works well)</li>
                    <li>Gently stir and let sit for ~2-3 minutes</li>
                    <li>Put desired amount of pearls into your cup of tea and enjoy!</li>
                </ol>
