        <!--DETAILED SUMMARY-->
        <!--Not sure how I want to arrange it yet-->
        <div class="summary detail">
            <p>
                Throughout all of my technical experiences, I strive to help make people's work better. I love learning how individuals
                engage with others and their environments; this drive is what led me to my self-designed data science major, with a
                focus in social psychology. <br>

                My experiences in both IT and academia nurtured my love for people, my love for technology, and
                my love
                for learning. This all comes together in one of my major goals: My goal to create user-friendly
                experiences, for
                both the users and developers. Ultimately technology can help everyone, and I want to help connect
                people to it.
