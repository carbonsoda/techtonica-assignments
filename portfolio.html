            <p>
                My experiences in both IT support and academia nurtured my love for people, my love for technology, and
                my love
                for learning. This all comes together in one of my major goals: My goal to create user-friendly
                experiences, for
                both the users and developers. Ultimately technology can help everyone, and I want to help connect
                people to it.
