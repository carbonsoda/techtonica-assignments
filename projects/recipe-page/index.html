            <h2>DIY Boba / Bubble Tea</h2>
            <div class="description">
                <p>
                    A lot of my friends love bubble tea, which have chewy tapioca pearls ("bubbles"). It's popular around many college campuses, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many things like classes are online and/or businesses have closed in the meantime.

                    <blockquote>
                        "I miss boba so much :(" <br>
                        "There's no good boba places near me" <br>
                        "I wish I could afford boba more than once a week"
                    </blockquote>
                <p>
                    If you don't have access and/or the funds for boba, it's possible to make it yourself!! It's super easy and quick too.

                    <ul>
                        <li>1/2 cup tapioca pearls</li>
                        <li>16 oz of desired tea (minimum amt)</li>
                        <li>~ 1 tsp - 1/4 cup of desired sweetener*</li>
                        <li>5 cups water (per 1/2 cup of pearls)</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>Notes</h3>
                <p>
                    You can buy tapioca pearls and instant milk tea online. A friend and I have tested a few instant milk teas; we found that Casa Milky Flavor Teas and 3:15PM to be the best brands for bubble tea. There are other good ones, but require 2+ packets per cup of boba, so it doesn't work out cost-wise.
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            For the Casa Milky Flavor Teas, we suggest the Okinawa (brown sugar) and Hokkaidou Sapporo varieties. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For 3:15PM, we suggest Original and Earl Gray. 
                                <br>The Rose one is okay, but risky choice if you never tried any rose milk tea before.

                    <h3>Instructions</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Fill a small or medium pot with 5 cups, or enough to fill the pot 2/3rds up (this can be eyeballed!)</li>
                        <li>Let water come to boil at high heat</li>
                        <li>Pour in the tapioca pearls</li>
                        <li>Slowly stir until all the pearls float to the surface (~1-2 min), making sure that pearls don't stick together</li>
                        <li>Lower the heat to medium and cover for ~ 2-3 minutes</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Taste one pearl to check for consistency, and leave for another ~ 2 minutes for a firmer consistency. </li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <li>Drain the pearls using a strainer and rinse with cold water. The pearls should still be warm</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>For springier boba: fill a bowl with cold tap water and let the pearls rest for ~30 seconds</li>
                            <li>For firmer boba: use cold water from the fridge instead of tap</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>
                            Put the pearls in a bowl and cover it with the desired sweetener <br>
                            Multiple sweeteners can be used at once, ie maple syrup + brown sugar
                        </li>
                        <li>Gently stir and let sit for ~5 minutes</li>
                        <li>Put desired amount of pearls into your cup of tea and enjoy!</li>
                    </ol>
